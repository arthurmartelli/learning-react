# Importing and Exporting Components

> The magic of components lies in their reusability: you can create components that are composed of other components. But as you nest more and more components, it often makes sense to start splitting them into different files. This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse components in more places.

## The root component file

In Create React App, your app lives in `src/App.js`. Depending on your setup, your root component could be in another file, though. If you use a framework with file-based routing, such as Next.js, your root component will be different for every page.

## Exporting and importing a component

There are several reasons to move components to different files: modularity, organization, easier use, etc. To move a component to a different file you need to follow three steps.

1. Make a new JS file to put the components in.
2. Export your function component from that file (using either default or named exports).
3. Import it in the file where you’ll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing default or named exports).

### Default vs named exports

There are two primary ways to export values with JavaScript: default exports and named exports. So far, our examples have only used default exports. But you can use one or both of them in the same file. A file can have no more than one default export, but it can have as many named exports as you like.

How you export your component dictates how you must import it. You will get an error if you try to import a default export the same way you would a named export! This chart can help you keep track:

| Syntax  | Export statement                      | Import statement                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Default | `export default function Button() {}` | `import Button from './Button.js';`     |
| Named   | `export function Button() {}`         | `import { Button } from './Button.js';` |

When you write a default import, you can put any name you want after import. For example, you could write import Banana from './Button.js' instead and it would still provide you with the same default export. In contrast, with named imports, the name has to match on both sides. That’s why they are called named imports!

People often use default exports if the file exports only one component, and use named exports if it exports multiple components and values. Regardless of which coding style you prefer, always give meaningful names to your component functions and the files that contain them. Components without names, like export default () => {}, are discouraged because they make debugging harder.

## Exporting and importing multiple components from the same file

What if you want to show just one Profile instead of a gallery? You can export the Profile component, too. But Gallery.js already has a default export, and you can’t have two default exports. You could create a new file with a default export, or you could add a named export for Profile. A file can only have one default export, but it can have numerous named exports!

You can have multiple named exports in one file, and you can have ne default export. To import both, the syntax would be `import Gallery, { Profile } from './Gallery.js';`. To avoid confusion, it's often a good practice to stick to one style, default or named. Or at least don't have both on the same file.
