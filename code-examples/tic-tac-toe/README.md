# Code Example: Tic Tac Toe

This is an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

## Entry Point

- [src/App.js](./src/App.js): The code in App.js creates a component. In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application.
- [src/styles.css](./src/styles.css): This file defines the styles for your React app. The first two CSS selectors (`*` and `body`) define the style of large parts of your app while the `.square` selector defines the style of any component where the `className` property is set to `square`. In your code, that would match the button from your Square component in the App.js file.
- [src/index.js](./src/index.js): It's the bridge between the component you created in the App.js file and the web browser.

To run the app, use:

```bash
npm start
```
