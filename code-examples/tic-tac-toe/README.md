# Code Example: Tic Tac Toe

This is an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React + SWC, using vite.

## Entry Point

- [src/App.tsx](./src/App.js): The code in App.tsx creates a component. In React, a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application.
- [src/App.css](./src/App.css): This file defines the styles for your React app. The `.square` selector defines the style of any component where the `className` property is set to `square`. In your code, that would match the button from your Square component in the App.tsx file.
- [src/main.tsx](./src/main.tsx): It's the bridge between the component you created in the App.tsx file and the web browser.

To run the app, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
