# React Pokemon App

This is a simple React app that allows the user to view a list of Pokemon retrieved from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). The app implements pagination to allow the user to navigate through multiple pages of results.

## Installation

To install the app, you will need to clone this repository and install the dependencies by running: `npm install`

## Usage

To start the app, run the following command: `npm run dev`

## Functionality

The app will retrieve a list of Pokemon from the PokeAPI and display them in a list. The list is paginated, allowing the user to navigate through multiple pages of results.

To navigate to the next page of results, click the "Next" button at the bottom of the page. If there are no more results, the "Next" button will be disabled.

To navigate to the previous page of results, click the "Prev" button at the bottom of the page. If you are on the first page of results, the "Prev" button will be disabled.

Clicking on a Pokemon in the list will display more information about that Pokemon, including its name, height, weight, and abilities.
